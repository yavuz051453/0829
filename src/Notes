What is git?
it is a version control tool

What is a local repository
a storage that is on our computer

What is a remote repository
github

Architecture of git?
it is 3 stage architecture
a) working
b)staging area
c)repo (local)

What are those
a?  folder that all project files are located (pom, src, target, .idea, )
my directory is (e.g., gitproject01)
Where should u create your git repository?
ideally, you should create your repo inside your working directory in this case of gitproject01
***no sub repository should be created***
One repo for one single repo and no sub repo is adviced


--------Tracking your first project using git----------------


a)  First open gitBash and cd to location by Desktop\....GitTesting
b)initialize an empty repository (git init)>>>it will create .git file that not visible
//to delete a repo, simply delete the .git folder
c) as soons as I run git status, it will check staging area and local repo
which also shows untracked files in red color
also the tracked files in green

d) git add . will copy things from staging area to local repo
git log will show author date code

-------------------Some Advance git commands----------------------------

1) to view the files in your staging area   >>> git ls -files
   will show me what files are in staging area
2) to remove any files from the staging area only    >>>> git rm --cached src -r
3) to restore files from staging area to your working directory   use  -->>>> git restore .
4) to see the difference between the local repo and working directory >>>>  git diff
5) to see the diff between the staging area and repository   >>>  git diff --staged

---------------------------The gitignore file-------

to ignore the file from being tracked by git, we use gitignore
a) create a .gitignore file >>>>    touch .gitignore
Let's say a text file created. To not track the txt, type that txt file (abc.txt) in gitignore.txt file.
This way, that created abc.txt file will not tracked
b) if you want to ignore a complete folder, write down the name of the folder in gitignore
e.g., if you want to ignore target folder in .gitignore type    target/
